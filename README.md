<h1>Student Assignment Tracker & Deadline Reminder</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
The Student Assignment Tracker & Deadline Reminder is a Python-based application that I have made to help students (and myself)
organise academic work, manage deadlines, and prioritise assignments efficiently.
</p>

<p>
The system addresses a common real-world problem where students struggle to track multiple assignments across
different subjects, often resulting in missed deadlines. This application provides a simple, reliable solution
with persistent data storage and automatic deadline tracking.
